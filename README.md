**by: Roshan Khemlani | SG-DSI-14**

## Problem Statement

Build a model to predict the future price of EUR/USD currency pair using historical close price data along with various variables such as economic and financial indicators.

## Target Audiences

This model is targeted to Hedge Funds, Financial Institutions and Multinational Corporations with investments/businesses in both United States and Europe. It allows them to mitigate their risk from market volatility by hedging against their open positions/obligations.

**Conclusions**

By looking at the Arima model, we can conclude that financial data cannot be predicted just by using the endogenous variables as they tend be more sensitive with exogenous features as well. As per EDA we could see high volatility in the price in 2001 (9/11 Attacks), 2009 (Mortgage Financial Crisis) and 2016 (Brexit). Apart from Economic and Financial data, other events like Geo-Political or Natural disasters can also play a major role in determining the price
